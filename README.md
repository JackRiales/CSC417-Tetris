Concept:
    Create tetris, except harder!

Platform:
    Pygame

Usage:
    $> python Tetris.py

Changes:

1. Stage width tripled.
2. Random / null rotations.
3. New, difficult to manage block shapes.
4. Block that rotates itself.

Issues and Fixes:

1. A feature was added to make the blocks move slower horizontally and faster vertically. This became too hard.
2. New blocks were added, but one in the shape of a checker board was too much.
